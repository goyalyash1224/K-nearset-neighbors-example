# K-nearset-neighbors-example
In this example first I analyse the data and standardize the values of data and make a dataframe from these standardize values .
After making dataframe i use this dataframe to classify our data using knn classifier by putting k=1.
After showing the results for k=1 I iterate the values of k from 1 to 40 to see the best value of k to fit on model.
Then I use the value of k=30 to fit the model which gives a pretty good result for the data.
